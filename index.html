        <h2>The Marvel Universe is a fictional world in which the stories of Marvel Comics take place. It also serves as continuity for all media forms based on these properties, with many television programs and video games being directly connected to it.</h2>
        <h2>There are actually 2 Marvel Universes.</h2>
        <h2>The Marvel Cinematic Universe of which their 'movie' timelines take place.</h2>
        <h2>And the Marvel Comics Universe. The conic Universe follows a different timeline and events than the comic one.</h2>

        <h1><a id="breathe">Marvel Characters are More Likely To Struggle.</a></h1>
        <h2>One of the critical characteristics of the Marvel comic universe is that their characters/ heroes are more likely to struggle. This is seen in their movies, comics, and TV shows, which focus on the struggles that these heroes are going through more often than not (due to Marvel's realistic style).</h2>
        <h2>They also tend to be born like ordinary people who undergo accidents and transformations to gain their power.</h2>
        <h2>Peter Parker was just an ordinary kid who was bitten by a radioactive spider and gained the powers of Spiderman. However, Bruce Banner is not born with his ability (the Hulk). But instead, he transforms into him from time to time because of exposure to gamma rays.</h2>
        <h2>Captain America was a skinny kid from Brooklyn who was turned into 'Cap' by the super-soldier serum.</h2>

        <h1>DC characters Are More Likely To Be Born Great.</h1>
    <h2>In contrast to the Marvel roster, the DC heroes tend to be born great.</h2>
    <h2>They have magical powers, mystical origins, or they were born into a wealthy family.</h2>
    <h2>Superman was sent to Earth by his father Jor-El from Krypton with extraordinary abilities and given human parents on Earth, so he could be raised as an average person who would not know of the planet's destruction until it is too late.</h2>
    <h2>Wonder Woman is also a demi-god who was raised on the island of Themyscira by her mother, Queen Hippolyta and trained to be an Amazonian warrior.</h2>
    <h2>Batman is also born at Wayne Manor with his parents Thomas and Martha, but he has no superpowers or abilities; instead, he possesses great wealth.</h2>
    <h2>Aquaman is born from the Atlantean King, who inherited his power.</h2>
    <h2>Even Cyborg was a great college footballer.</h2>
    <h2>For the majority of DC characters, life tends to have come with many advantages.</h2>
